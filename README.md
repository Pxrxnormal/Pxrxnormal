- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pxrxnormal
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming, Scripting, and Game Development
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to code lua as that is the most simple computer language I know. I know much more, but Lua is the most simple out of my knowledge
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ROBLOX game engines. You can hire me as a scripter, Builder or something else. I'd be more than happy to do it.
